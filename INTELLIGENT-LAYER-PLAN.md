# Notioc Intelligent Layer Plan
## Complete Canvas Visibility + Intelligent Orchestration for Students

**Core Goal**: Give Claude complete access to everything a student can see on Canvas, enabling hypercontextualized responses by combining all available course data.

**Philosophy**: 
1. **Complete Visibility**: If a student can see it in Canvas ‚Üí Claude can access it
2. **No Gaps**: Expose hidden/underutilized Canvas features (Analytics, Planner, Notifications)
3. **Intelligent Orchestration**: Combine multiple Canvas APIs to answer complex questions
4. **Natural Language**: Students ask questions naturally, Claude navigates Canvas's API complexity

---

## Current Coverage Audit (What Students Can Access)

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented (44 tools)
- **Courses**: List, details, navigation, syllabus, modules, structure
- **Assignments**: List, details, rubrics, previous submissions, submission history
- **Grades**: Current grades, analytics, what-if scenarios, trends, categories
- **Files**: Enhanced browser, search, content extraction, LlamaParse processing
- **Discussions**: Read, post, reply, threads
- **Groups**: List, details, members, discussions
- **Quizzes**: List, details, submissions, review past quizzes
- **Calendar**: Events, due dates
- **Messages**: Send, receive conversations
- **Pages**: Course pages, content
- **Dashboard**: Basic overview
- **Users**: Profiles, search

### ‚ùå Missing (Student Can See But Notioc Can't Access)
- **Account Notifications** - Global alerts, campus announcements ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GAP
- **Canvas Analytics Dashboard** - Participation metrics, engagement scores ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GAP
- **Planner/TODO List** - Canvas's unified planning view ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GAP
- **Peer Reviews** - Assigned peer reviews, received feedback ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GAP
- **CommMessages** - System notifications (grade posted, feedback available)
- **Content Shares** - Items shared directly by instructors
- **Course Nicknames** - Student's renamed courses
- **Favorites** - Starred courses/groups
- **Bookmarks** - Saved Canvas pages
- **Recent History** - Recently viewed pages
- **Module Progress States** - Mark items complete/incomplete
- **Submission Read States** - Track unread feedback
- **Assignment TODO Status** - Canvas's assignment tracking
- **Course Activity Stream** - Recent activity feed
- **Announcement Read States** - Unread announcements
- **Discussion Summaries** - Canvas's AI-generated summaries

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Incomplete (Partial Access)
- **Submissions**: Can read but can't track read/unread feedback states
- **Modules**: Can list but can't mark items complete or track progress
- **Discussions**: Can read/post but missing: upvote, Canvas AI summaries, better read tracking
- **Files**: Can read/search but can't update/delete student's own uploads

---

---

## Revised Goal: Complete Canvas Parity

**Target**: Claude has 100% read access to everything visible to a student in Canvas web UI

**Why This Matters**:
- **Hypercontextualized Responses**: Claude can see full course state (not just isolated data)
- **No Blind Spots**: Students won't ask "why can't you see X?" when they can see it in Canvas
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: With complete visibility, Claude can suggest priorities, identify patterns, predict problems

**Example - Current Gap**:
```
Student: "What do I need to work on today?"
Claude (without complete visibility): "You have 3 assignments due this week"
Claude (with complete visibility): "URGENT: You have a peer review due in 4 hours, 
  2 unread instructor feedback comments from last week, a campus notification about 
  library closures affecting your research, and your Biology participation is in 
  the bottom 25% of class (18 page views vs class avg 47)"
```

## Phase 1: Critical Student Workflow Gaps (Week 1) - ‚úÖ 2/5 COMPLETE (40%)
**Goal**: Fill the gaps that make students miss important shit

### 1.1 Account Notifications ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status**: Implemented October 1, 2025
**Why**: Students are blind to system-wide alerts (campus closures, policy changes, emergencies)

**API Endpoints**: ‚úÖ Implemented
- `GET /api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/account_notifications` - List active notifications
- `DELETE /api/v1/accounts/{account_id}/account_notifications/{id}` - Close/dismiss notification

**New Tool**: ‚úÖ `get_account_notifications`
**Implementation Files**:
- `tools/notifications.ts` - Core implementation (170 lines)
- `mcp.ts` - Tool registration and handler

**Features Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Fetches active account-level notifications
- ‚úÖ Auto-resolves user's account ID
- ‚úÖ Filters by active date range
- ‚úÖ Priority-based sorting (error > warning > info)
- ‚úÖ Icon formatting (üö® error, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning, ‚ÑπÔ∏è info, üìÖ calendar, ‚ùì question)
- ‚úÖ Dismiss notification capability (implemented but not yet exposed as tool)
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling when notifications unavailable

**Example Output**:
```
üì¢ Active Account Notifications (2):

üö® Campus Closure - Hurricane Warning
   All classes cancelled Oct 15-17 due to severe weather. 
   Campus facilities will be closed.
   Active: 10/14/2025 - 10/18/2025
   ID: 12345

‚ÑπÔ∏è Library Hours Extended for Finals Week
   The main library will be open 24/7 starting Dec 10.
   Active: 12/1/2025 - Ongoing
   ID: 12346
```

**Student Value**: "Are there any important announcements I need to know about?"

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ Clean compilation, no TypeScript errors

---

### 1.2 Canvas Analytics API ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL - ‚è≥ NEXT
**Why**: Canvas already calculates participation, assignment patterns, engagement metrics - we're just not exposing it!

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/analytics/student_summaries` - All students summary (filtered to current user)
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/analytics/users/{user_id}/activity` - Participation data
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/analytics/users/{user_id}/assignments` - Assignment performance trends
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/analytics/users/{user_id}/communication` - Messaging activity

**New Tools**:

**`get_course_analytics`**
```typescript
// Input: { courseId: "12345" }
// Returns Canvas's own calculated metrics:
{
  participation: {
    pageViews: 245,
    participations: 42, // discussions, submissions, etc.
    pageViewsLevel: "high" | "medium" | "low",
    participationsLevel: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  },
  assignments: [
    {
      title: "Essay 1",
      dueAt: "...",
      submitted: true,
      onTime: true,
      score: 85,
      pointsPossible: 100
    }
  ],
  tardiness: {
    missing: 2,
    late: 3,
    onTime: 15,
    total: 20
  }
}
```

**`get_student_performance_summary`**
```typescript
// Input: { courseId: "12345" }
// Combines analytics + grades for complete picture
{
  currentGrade: "82%",
  engagement: "medium", // from Canvas Analytics
  riskFactors: [
    "2 missing assignments",
    "Low participation (15 page views this week vs avg 45)"
  ],
  strengths: [
    "100% on-time submission rate for completed work",
    "Above average discussion participation"
  ]
}
```

**Student Value**: "How am I doing in Biology?" ‚Üí Get real engagement metrics, not just grades

---

### 1.3 Peer Reviews ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Why**: Students miss peer review deadlines because they don't know they exist

**API Endpoints**:

- `DELETE /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions/{submission_id}/peer_reviews/{user_id}` - Delete peer review

**New Tools**:

**`list_peer_reviews`**
```typescript
// Input: { courseId: "12345", assignmentId: "67890" }
// Returns:
{
  myReviewsToComplete: [
    {
      assesseeId: "anonymous_student_1",
      assesseeName: "Anonymous Student", // if anonymous
      submissionUrl: "...",
      dueDate: "2025-10-15T23:59:00Z",
      completed: false
    }
  ],
  reviewsOfMyWork: [
    {
      assessorName: "Jane Smith",
      completedAt: "2025-10-10T14:30:00Z",
      comments: "Great analysis of the topic..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**`get_peer_review_submission`**
```typescript
// Input: { courseId, assignmentId, submissionId }
// Returns the submission content to review
```

**Student Value**: "Do I have any peer reviews to complete?" "What feedback did I get from peers?"

---

### 1.4 What-If Grade Calculator ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CRITICAL
**Why**: This is THE killer feature students want - "what grade do I need on the final?"

**API Endpoints**:
- Canvas doesn't have a direct API for this, but we can calculate it using:
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/assignment_groups` - Get weighted categories
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/assignments` - All assignments with points
- `GET /api/v1/courses/{course_id}/enrollments` - Current grades

**New Tool**: `calculate_what_if_grade`
```typescript
// Input: 
{
  courseId: "12345",
  scenarios: [
    { assignmentId: "111", hypotheticalScore: 95 },
    { assignmentId: "222", hypotheticalScore: 88 }
  ]
}

// Returns:
{
  currentGrade: 82.5,
  projectedGrade: 87.3,
  breakdown: {
    "Exams (40%)": { current: 85, projected: 92 },
    "Assignments (30%)": { current: 78, projected: 82 },
    "Participation (30%)": { current: 85, projected: 85 }
  },
  recommendations: [
    "Score 92% on Final Exam to achieve A (90%)",
    "Even with 100% on Final, max possible grade is 94.2%"
  ]
}
```

**Student Value**: "What do I need on the final to get an A?" "If I bomb this quiz, can I still pass?"
