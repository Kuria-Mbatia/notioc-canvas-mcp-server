# Custom GPT Integration (Coming Soon)

> **Note:** Custom GPT integration for the Notioc Canvas MCP Server is currently under development. This feature will be available in a future update. Currently, the Notioc Canvas MCP Server is focused on Claude Desktop integration only.

## Using Claude Desktop Instead

While waiting for Custom GPT integration, we recommend using Claude Desktop with the Notioc Canvas MCP Server:

1. Follow the [README.md](./README.md) for installation instructions
2. See [CLAUDE-SETUP.md](./CLAUDE-SETUP.md) for detailed Claude Desktop setup

Claude Desktop offers several advantages:
- Local processing for enhanced privacy
- Direct MCP integration
- No need for cloud deployment
- Full access to all Canvas features

## Future Custom GPT Features

When the Custom GPT integration is available, you'll be able to:
- üìö **Get your courses**: "Show me my Canvas courses"
- üìÑ **Browse pages**: "What pages are in my English course?"
- üí¨ **Read discussions**: "Check the latest announcements in my course"
- üìù **View assignments**: "What assignments do I have due this week?"
- üìÅ **Find files**: "Find all PDF files in my course"
- üîç **Read content**: "Read the syllabus page for me"

## Implementation Timeline

We're working to implement Custom GPT integration in the future. This will include:

1. **REST API Wrapper**: A dedicated API server for Custom GPT Actions
2. **OpenAPI Schema**: Updated specifications for GPT integration
3. **Authentication**: Secure access to your Canvas data
4. **Deployment Options**: Instructions for various hosting platforms

## When Will This Be Available?

We don't have a specific release date yet, but we're actively working on this feature. In the meantime, Claude Desktop offers a complete solution with all the functionality you need.

## Why Use Claude Desktop Now?

Claude Desktop integration offers several advantages over waiting for Custom GPT:

1. **Privacy**: All processing happens locally on your machine
2. **No Deployment**: No need to set up cloud hosting or expose APIs
3. **Full Feature Set**: Access to all Canvas features and tools
4. **Simple Setup**: Direct integration through configuration files

## Getting Started with Claude Desktop

While we develop the Custom GPT integration, here's how to get started with Claude Desktop:

1. **Install Claude Desktop**: Download from [Anthropic's website](https://claude.ai/desktop)
2. **Set Up the MCP Server**: Follow instructions in [README.md](./README.md)
3. **Configure Claude**: Follow detailed instructions in [CLAUDE-SETUP.md](./CLAUDE-SETUP.md)

## Feature Comparison

## Security Considerations

When using Claude Desktop with the Notioc Canvas MCP Server:

- API keys are stored locally in configuration files
