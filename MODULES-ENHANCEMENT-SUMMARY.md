# Canvas Modules Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive enhancements made to the Canvas Modules functionality in the MCP server, designed to enable Claude to be more agentic and autonomous in exploring course content.

## Enhancement Date
December 2024

## Goals
1. Enable Claude to automatically understand course structure without explicit navigation commands
2. Provide actionable guidance on which tools to use for different resource types
3. Show completion requirements, due dates, and prerequisites prominently
4. Organize module content in a way that facilitates autonomous exploration

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `list_modules` Handler

**Location:** `mcp.ts` (lines ~2956-3030)

**New Features:**
- **Prerequisites Display**: Shows which modules must be completed before others can be accessed
- **Sequential Progress Tracking**: Indicates if modules must be completed in order
- **Unlock Date Information**: Displays when locked modules will become available
- **Completion Status**: Shows overall progress with completed/total item counts
- **Item Type Summaries**: Breaks down module contents by type (Assignments, Quizzes, Pages, Files, etc.)
- **State Indicators**: Clearly marks Published, Unpublished, and Completed states

**Example Output:**
```
Module: Week 1 - Introduction
  State: Published
  Prerequisites: Must complete "Getting Started" module first
  Sequential: Yes (must complete items in order)
  Position: 1
  Progress: 5/8 items completed
  Items: 3 Pages, 2 Assignments, 2 Quizzes, 1 Discussion
```

### 2. Enhanced `get_module_items` Handler

**Location:** `mcp.ts` (lines ~2976-3150)

**New Features:**
- **Smart Categorization**: Groups items by type (üìÑ Pages, üìù Assignments, üìä Quizzes, üìÅ Files, üí¨ Discussions, üîó External URLs, üõ†Ô∏è External Tools, üìå SubHeaders)
- **Completion Requirements**: Prominently displays what's required (must_view, must_submit, must_contribute, min_score)
- **Due Date Tracking**: Shows due dates with ‚ö†Ô∏è warnings for overdue items
- **Lock Status**: Indicates locked items with explanations
- **Tool Suggestions**: Provides specific commands for accessing each item type
- **Summary Statistics**: Shows counts of completed, locked, and overdue items at a glance
- **Status Indicators**: Marks Draft and Completed items clearly

**Example Output:**
```
üìù ASSIGNMENTS (2 items)
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
1. Essay Assignment
   ‚úÖ Completed
   Due: Dec 15, 2024
   Completion: Must submit
   To Access: Use get_assignment with assignmentId: 12345

2. Problem Set 1
   Due: Dec 20, 2024 ‚ö†Ô∏è OVERDUE
   Completion: Must submit with min_score: 80%
   To Access: Use get_assignment with assignmentId: 12346

SUMMARY STATISTICS
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Total items: 12
Completed: 5
Locked: 2
Overdue: 1
```

### 3. Updated Tool Descriptions

**Location:** `mcp.ts` (lines ~1141-1177)

**list_modules Description:**
- Updated to mention prerequisites, sequential progress, unlock dates, completion status, and item summaries
- Emphasizes comprehensive details for autonomous navigation

**get_module_items Description:**
- Updated to mention smart categorization, completion requirements, due dates, lock status, and tool suggestions
- Highlights summary statistics for quick overview

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions Added

1. **Item Categorization Logic**
   - Groups items by `type` field (Assignment, Quiz, Page, File, Discussion, ExternalUrl, ExternalTool, SubHeader)
   - Uses emoji indicators for visual clarity
   - Handles all Canvas item types

2. **Completion Requirement Parsing**
   - Extracts `completion_requirement` from each item
   - Displays requirement type (must_view, must_submit, must_contribute, must_mark_done, min_score)
   - Shows minimum score requirements when applicable

3. **Due Date Processing**
   - Parses `content_details.due_at` timestamps
   - Compares with current date to identify overdue items
   - Formats dates in human-readable format

4. **Lock Status Handling**
   - Checks `content_details.locked_for_user` flag
   - Displays `lock_explanation` when available
   - Indicates locked items prominently

5. **Tool Suggestion Engine**
   - Maps each item type to appropriate MCP tool
   - Provides specific parameters (e.g., pageUrl for Pages, assignmentId for Assignments)
   - Enables Claude to autonomously access resources

6. **Progress Tracking**
   - Calculates completed/total ratios
   - Identifies overdue and locked items
   - Provides summary statistics

### Data Structures Used

**Module Object (from Canvas API):**
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  position: number;
  unlock_at?: string;
  require_sequential_progress?: boolean;
  prerequisite_module_ids?: number[];
  state?: string;
  completed_at?: string;
  items_count?: number;
  items?: ModuleItem[];
}
```

**ModuleItem Object (from Canvas API):**
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  title: string;
  type: string; // Assignment, Quiz, Page, File, Discussion, ExternalUrl, ExternalTool, SubHeader
  position: number;
  indent: number;
  content_id?: number;
  html_url?: string;
  url?: string;
  page_url?: string;
  external_url?: string;
  published?: boolean;
  completion_requirement?: {
    type: string; // must_view, must_submit, must_contribute, must_mark_done, min_score
    min_score?: number;
    completed: boolean;
  };
  content_details?: {

}
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With:

## Benefits for Claude's Agentic Behavior

1. **Autonomous Navigation**: Claude can now understand course structure without user having to explain it
2. **Contextual Awareness**: Knows what's completed, what's locked, what's overdue
3. **Tool Discovery**: Learns which tools to use for different resource types
4. **Priority Identification**: Can identify overdue assignments and incomplete requirements
5. **Prerequisite Understanding**: Knows what must be completed before accessing other content
6. **Resource Mapping**: Understands the full landscape of course materials

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student Asks "What's due soon?"
Claude can:
1. Use `list_modules` to see all modules
2. Use `get_module_items` on relevant modules
3. Identify items with due dates
4. Filter for overdue items (marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è)
5. Prioritize by due date
6. Suggest tools to access those items

### Scenario 2: Student Asks "What should I work on next?"
Claude can:
1. Use `list_modules` to see sequential requirements
2. Identify prerequisites and completion status
3. Use `get_module_items` to see incomplete items
4. Check completion requirements
5. Suggest next logical step based on prerequisites
6. Provide exact tool command to access that item

### Scenario 3: Student Asks "Why can't I access this module?"
Claude can:
1. Use `list_modules` to check prerequisites
2. Identify which prerequisite modules aren't completed
3. Show unlock dates if applicable
4. Explain sequential progress requirements
5. Suggest completing prerequisite items first

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Sequential Modules**: Verify prerequisite display works correctly
2. **Test with Overdue Items**: Ensure overdue warnings appear prominently
3. **Test with Locked Content**: Check that lock explanations are shown
4. **Test with Mixed Item Types**: Verify all item types categorize correctly
5. **Test with Large Modules**: Ensure performance is acceptable with 50+ items
6. **Test Tool Suggestions**: Verify suggested tools actually work with provided parameters

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Mastery Paths**: Display conditional release paths when available
2. **Module Progress Bars**: Visual representation of completion percentage
3. **Item Dependencies**: Show item-level prerequisites within modules
4. **Completion Time Estimates**: Suggest how long items might take
5. **Smart Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for what to do next
6. **Due Date Reminders**: Proactive alerts for upcoming deadlines
7. **Group by Due Date**: Alternative view grouping items by when they're due
8. **Filter by Completion**: Show only incomplete items option
