# ChatGPT Integration (Coming Soon)

> **Note:** ChatGPT integration for the Notioc Canvas MCP Server is currently under development. This functionality will be available in a future update.

## Current Limitations

At this time, the Notioc Canvas MCP Server is optimized for integration with Claude Desktop only. ChatGPT integration requires additional work to support GPT's Custom Actions API.

## Why Claude-First?

We're focusing on Claude Desktop integration first because:

1. It offers a more straightforward Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration path
2. It provides enhanced privacy with local processing capabilities
3. It works well with our current architecture

## Planned ChatGPT Integration

In future updates, we plan to add support for ChatGPT integration via:

- Custom GPT Actions API support
- REST API wrapper for web access
- Cloud deployment options

## When Will It Be Available?

We're actively working on ChatGPT integration. If you're interested in this feature, please:

1. Star our GitHub repository for updates
2. Check back for announcements
3. Consider using Claude Desktop in the meantime

## Alternative: Using Claude Desktop Now

While waiting for ChatGPT integration, you can use the Notioc Canvas MCP Server with Claude Desktop by following the instructions in the [README.md](./README.md) and [CLAUDE-SETUP.md](./CLAUDE-SETUP.md) files.
